# CNN_pretrain

CNNs have produced great results. But a problem they have is that they
require too much data. Could there be ways to initialize their weights
such that this requirement is loosed? This code checks some ideas, for
example: can we initialize the CNN using the weights of the CAE (as it
was already proposed in the original CAE article)? Do we actually get
better results if we do that? And what about Greedy layer-wise pre-
training? But how to adapt it to the convolutional nature of CNNs?
